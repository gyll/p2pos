P2P Application Server

The P2P OS project aims at building a P2P application server which should provide third-party applications with the ability to connect over a P2P network. 

The P2P OS project blog is here: http://p2p-os.blogspot.com

I am currently looking for partners to turn the proof-of-concept prototype into a product. Please contact me if you're interested using the blog's 'Contact' page.
